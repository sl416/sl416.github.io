			<h2>How to Play Twenty One</h2>
			<h3>Objective and Rules:</h3> 
			<h4>
				Bring your hand as close to 21 without going over 21 by taking extra cards from the deck. <br /><br />
				The computer will be the dealer. You and the player are dealt 2 cards. Both of your cards are face up. One of the dealer’s cards is face up and the other is face down. <br /><br />
				● All numbered cards are worth their face value in points. <br />
				● All picture cards are worth 10 points. <br />
				● Aces can be worth 1 point or 11 points depending on the hand.<br />
			</h4>
			<h3>You have 2 opportunities:</h3>
			<h4>
				1) Stay <br />
				Your turn ends. The dealer flips over its face down card and must complete its hand. <br /><br />
				2) Hit <br />
				You get the next card from the deck. You can keep this up until decide to stay, or bust. 
			</h4>
			<h3>Bust</h3>
			<h4> A bust is when you go over 21. The dealer wins. </h4>
			<h3>Dealer's Turn</h3>
			<h4>If the dealer has less than 17, it must hit. If the dealer has 17 or over, it must stay. </h4>
			<h3>Deciding the Winner</h3>
			<h4>The player with the hand closest to 21 wins. If you and the dealer have the same number of points, it’s a tie and no one wins.</h4>
